\title{Compute the effective population size}
\usage{
get_n_eff(traits_comm, comp_width = default_comp_width())
}
\arguments{
\item{traits_comm}{numeric vector of variable length, the trait values of
every individual in the community.}

\item{comp_width}{numeric \eqn{>= 0}. Width of the competition kernel.}
}
\description{
Computes \eqn{n_eff}, the effective population size experienced by an
individual.
}
\details{
\code{n_eff} sums the competitive effects an individual receives from
every individual in the community, including the individual itself. It is
called effective population size because it is the size of the population
that is relevant for competition.
Varies from 1 (no competitor in the vicinity) to N (every individual has the
same trait value).
