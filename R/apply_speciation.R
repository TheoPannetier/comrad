#' Resolve speciation in a comrad community
#'
#' For each species, check if there is any gap `>= trait_dist_sp` in trait
#' values, and split the relevant species in two when one is found. The less
#' numerous half becomes the new species.
#'
#' @inheritParams default_params_doc
#' @note `apply_speciation()` can currently only split one species into two. If
#' multiple gaps emerge in a species at a single time step, only the first one
#' will be treated. As long as branching does not happen at every generation,
#' this is unlikely to be an issue, because an unresolved gap will be caught on
#' the next time step. In phylogenetic terms, this results in polytomies being
#' resolved as soft polytomies.
#' Besides, simultaneous branching events in different species are handled
#' perfectly fine.
