#' Plot community size over generations
#'
#' Plots the number of individuals in the community over time.
#'
#' @param comrad_tbl a tibble containing the output of a `comrad` simulation,
#' as produced by [run_simulation()].
#' @param colouring character specifying how to colour each species. Default
#' `auto` lets `ggplot` pick colours as usual. `species_names` is used when
#' colour hexes are sampled as species names during the simulation, and will
#' colour each species with its colour. This ensures consistency across plots
#' but may make colours harder to distinguish based on which hexes where
#' sampled.
